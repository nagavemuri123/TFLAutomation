Used Page object model when designing framework
Added common step ( which is Given I am on plan a journey ) under Background so that it isnâ€™t duplicated in every scenario.
Used Bodi Object container to register JourneyPlanner page class instance.This means that instance is created once and can be reused.
Used Constructor Injection in JourneyPlannerSteps class - this way the injected component can be used anywhere in that class.
Added common used methods in BasePage class - this way the methods can be reused any where in the project just by inheriting BasePage class.
Used Selenium.Interactions.Actions to move to a particular element and perform the action, below is the code: 
Actions actions = new Actions(Driver);
            actions.MoveToElement(element);
            actions.Perform();
            ClickElement(element);
To locate elements,used Id/Classname/Cssselector as that is the best approach instead of XPath.
